Hi , I am `Satya Prakash` and here is some detail about me.
I am an `Information Security Enthusiast`, `Security Researcher`, `Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical)` and I am looking forward to be an `OSCP `Certified and work as an red team member in any good company.
I have recently completed my Post Graduation Diploma in Information Security and started Bug Hunting recently and currently working as an Web Application Security Analyst in a startup company.

I have hands experience and knowledge on manual testing over OWASP TOP-10 and I am familiar with `Web Applications`, `Computer Networking`, `Bash-Scripting`, `Basic programing language along` with all major O/S and learning Network Penetration Testing, VAPT, Bug Hunting and Some Red Team Attack Vectors. I am expanding my skills on TryHackMe and Hackthebox platform.

I have practical knowledge of some significant tools like `BurpSuite`, `Nikto`, `Nessus`, `Metasploit`, `SqlMap`, `Nmap`, `Wireshark` etc. I am an active participant in CTF challenges. Actively looking for any `opportunity` in the `InfoSec` Field for a `Red Team `/ `Penetration Testing` role.
