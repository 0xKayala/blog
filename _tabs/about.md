Hi , I am `Satya Prakash` and here is some detail about me.
I am an `Information Security Enthusiast`, `Security Researcher`, `Certified Ethical Hacker (Practical)` and looking forward to be an `OSCP `Certified and join red team member.
I have recently completed my Post Graduation Diploma in Information Security. I have started Bug Hunting recently and currently working as an Web Application Security Analyst in a startup company.

I have knowledge of `Web Application`, `Computer Networking`, `Bash-Scripting`, `Major programing language along` with all major O/S and learning Network Penetration Testing, VAPT, Bug Hunting and Some Red Team Attack Vectors. I am expanding my skills on TryHackMe and Hackthebox plateform.

I have knowledge of some significant tools like BurpSuite, OWASP TOP-10, Nikto,, Nessus, Metasploit, SqlMap, Nmap, Wireshark etc. I am also actively looking for any `opportunity` in the `InfoSec` Field for a `Red Team `/ `Penetration Testing` role.
